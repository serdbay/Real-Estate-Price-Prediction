## General Information
In this challenge, we will use a dataset of real estate sales transactions to predict the price-per-unit of a property based on its features. The price-per-unit in this data is based on a unit measurement of 3.3 square meters.

Our dataset was obtained from the UCI dataset repository (Dua, D. and Graff, C. (2019). UCI Machine Learning Repository. Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science).

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.10.5

## Setup
Before getting started with the project you need to familiar with machine learning and especially regression algoritm and you need to download our "real_estate.csv" file provided in this project.

## Usage
Anyone dealing with the real estate price changes based on varous features may use this project as a template. Especially if you have a dataset similar to one including in this project and if you want to infer some info based on the features you can use this project.
